Engineering Workshop
	

	Engineering Workshop is a basic practical subject that helps students learn fundamental workshop skills. It gives hands-on training in the use of common tools, machines, and materials used in engineering work. The workshop includes practical work in areas such as fitting, carpentry, welding, smithy, sheet metal, plumbing, and electrical wiring. Students learn simple operations like measuring, marking, cutting, drilling, shaping, and joining of materials. Safety practices are taught as an important part of the workshop. Students learn the correct use of tools, safety equipment, and good workshop habits. This helps in preventing accidents and maintaining a clean working environment.


The main objectives of the Engineering Workshop are:
* To understand basic engineering processes for manufacturing and assembly.
* To understand, identify, select and use various marking, measuring, and holding, striking and cutting tools and equipment’s
* To understand and interpret job drawings, produce jobs, and inspect the job for specified dimensions
* To understand the various types of wiring systems and acquire skills in house wiring
* To understand, operate, control different machines and equipment’s adopting safety practices
