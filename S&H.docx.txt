DEPARTMENT OF SCIENCE AND HUMANITIES


About the Department

The Department of Science and Humanities caters to allied subjects of basic sciences and communication, including Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and English Communication Skills, along with audit and open elective courses. It primarily supports the first year of the diploma programme, with a strong emphasis on building a solid academic foundation.


Teaching Methodology

Teaching and learning are carried out through a blend of classroom instruction and practical laboratory sessions. Interactive methods such as group discussions, role plays, and other participatory activities are employed to enhance understanding and communication skills. Field visits and industrial visits are also organized to provide students with practical exposure and a better understanding of concepts and topics.


Facilities Available in the Department

The department is equipped with well-furnished classrooms and fully functional laboratories to support effective teaching and learning. Facilities encourage interactive learning through group discussions and role plays. In addition, field visits and industrial visits are facilitated to enrich students’ practical knowledge and real-world understanding.












Laboratories


Physics Lab
	

	This laboratory focuses on application of principles of physics and aims to supplement the factual knowledge gained in theory by first hand experiments. This will develop scientific temper and help to apply the basic concepts and principles in solving engineering and technology-based problems. In addition, students get necessary confidence in handling equipment and thus learn various skills in measurement.


Some of the experiments performed are given below: 
* To determine diameter of a wire, a solid ball and thickness of cardboard using a screw
* gauge.
* To determine radius of curvature of a convex and a concave mirror/surface using a spherometer.
* To verify triangle and parallelogram law of forces.
* To find the co-efficient of friction between wood and glass using a horizontal board.
* To determine force constant of a spring using Hook’s Law.
* To verify law of conservation of mechanical energy (PE to KE)
	  

	

	

	  

	

	

	Chemistry Lab
	

	There are numerous of materials used in fabricating and manufacturing devices for the comfort of life. The selection, characterization and suitability assessment of natural raw materials essentially requires principles and concepts of Applied Chemistry for technicians. This lab aims to supplement the factual knowledge gained in the lectures by first hand experiments. This will develop scientific temper and help to apply the basic concepts and principles in solving engineering problems.


Some of the experiments performed are given below: 
* Preparation of standard solution of oxalic acid or potassium permanganate.
* To determine strength of given sodium hydroxide solution by titrating against standard oxalic acid solution using phenolphthalein indicator.
* Determine the conductivity of given water sample.
* Determination of the Iron content in given cement sample using colorimeter.
* Determination of calorific value of solid or liquid fuel using bomb calorimeter.
* Determination of viscosity of lubricating oil using Redwood viscometer.
* Determination of flash and fire point of lubricating oil using Able’s flash point apparatus.
	  

	

	

	  

	

	Language Lab
	

	Communication skills play an important role in career development. This lab aims at actively involving students in various activities to improve their communication skills with an emphasis on developing personality of the students. 


The main objectives of the Language lab are:
* To develop listening skills for enhancing communication.
* To develop speaking skills with a focus on correct pronunciation and fluency.
* To introduce the need for Personality development- Focus will be on developing certain qualities which will aid students in handling personal and career challenges, leadership skills etc. for that purpose group discussion, extempore and other activities should be conducted during lab classes.
