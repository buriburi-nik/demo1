Laboratories


Data Structures Lab
	

	This laboratory is intended to practice whatever is taught in theory class of ‘Data Structures’, ‘Algorithms’ and is an extension of previous course on ‘Computer Programming’. Students work on various problems listed in the text books and given by the teacher. This Lab course requires a good coordination between theory course in Data Structures and Algorithms. 


Some of the topics that are covered in lab are listed below:
* Search operation in a given list of integers using binary search technique
* Write a program to implement insertion sorting for a given random data
* Write a program to implement bubble sorting for a given random data
* Write a program to implement quick sorting for a given random data
* Write a program to implement selection sorting for a given random data
	Operating Systems Lab
	

	This laboratory is intended to practice and do experiment on concepts taught in theory class of ‘Operating Systems’ and gain insight into functioning of the Operating Systems.


Some of the topics that are covered in lab are listed below:
* Implement two-way process communication using pipes
* Implement message queue form of IPC
* Implement shared memory and semaphore form of IPC
* Simulate the CPU scheduling algorithms - Round Robin, SJF, FCFS, priority
* Simulate Bankers algorithm for Deadlock Avoidance and Prevention
	DBMS Lab
	

	This laboratory is intended to practice the concepts of the course ‘Introduction to DBMS’.
The students need to develop the case studies and apply all relevant concepts learnt in theory class
as the course progress, identify activities/operations that can be performed on the database. The students shall also use concepts learnt in the course on Software Engineering/SSAD.


Some of the topics/case studies that are covered in lab are listed below:
* Case Study-1: Employee database
* Case Study-2: Visitor Management database
* Case Study-3: Students Academic database
* Case Study-4: Inventory Management System database
* Case study-5: Bank Operations database
	Computer Networks Lab
	

	This laboratory is intended to practice concepts of ‘Computer Networks’ and apply for real-life problems.


Some of the topics/case studies that are covered in lab are listed below:


* Configuring computing devices (PC, Laptop, Mobile, etc.) for network, exploring different
* options and their impact – IP address, gateway, DNS, security options, etc.
* Showing various networking devices – NICs, Hub, Switch, Router, Wi-Fi access point, etc.
* Network simulation tool (e.g. Cisco Packet Tracer)
* Setting up a small wired LAN in the Lab
* Setting up a small wireless LAN in the Lab
	Web Technologies Lab
	

	This Lab course is intended to practice whatever is taught in theory class of ‘Web Technologies’ and apply for real-life problems.


Some of the topics/case studies that are covered in lab are listed below:
* Coding Server Client Programs
* Developing Web Application using HTML, JavaScript
* Developing Advanced Web Application Programs using CSS
* Practicing PHP: Basics
* Practicing PHP: Web Application Development
* Developing a fully functional Web Service Application using all the technologies learned in this course.
